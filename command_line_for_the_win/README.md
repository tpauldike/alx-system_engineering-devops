# Command Line for the Win
This optional project was all about taking some command line challenge, where we had to figure out the command to get certain tasks done on bash, from simple tasks such as printing hello world on the terminal, printing current working directory, to complex tasks that required performing multiple tasks in a single command.

We were supposed to take screenshots and push them to git when we were through with:
- the first 9 tasks
- the next 9 tasks, making it 18
- the nect 9 tasks, making it 27
